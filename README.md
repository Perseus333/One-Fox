## Customization
If you want to customize either the userChrome.css or the userContent.css you can do so freely by editing them in your preferred text or code editor.

However, you can algo change the wallpapers to better suit your preferences. 

To do so, just navigate to the userContent.css that will be found in your root directory ([See instructions](#Instructions)), and then go to `.\Chrome\userContent.css`. Modify line `19` with any other image path.

There are some recommended wallpapers inside the `newtab_backgrounds` that are found in the repository but not in the relase. You can use them if you want. This was done to make the file lighter.
